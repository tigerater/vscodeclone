# VSCode Tests

## Contents

This folder contains the various test runners for VSCode. Please refer to the documentation within for how to run them:
* `unit`: our suite of unit tests
* `integration`: our suite of API tests
* `smoke`: our suite of automated UI tests
* `ui`: our suite of manual UI tests



### Unit Tests (Electron-runner)

```
./scripts/test.[sh|bat]
```

All unit tests are run inside a electron-browser environment which access to DOM and Nodejs api. This is the closest to the enviroment in which VS Code itself ships. Notes:

- use the `--debug` to see an electron window with dev tools which allows for debugging
- to run only a subset of tests use the `--run` or `--glob` options

### Unit Tests (Browser-runner)

```
yarn test-browser --browser webkit --browser chromium
```

Unit tests from layers `common` and `browser` are run inside `chromium`, `webkit`, and (soonâ€™ish) `firefox` (using playwright). This complements our electron-based unit test runner and adds more coverage of supported platforms. Notes:

- these tests are part of the continuous build, that means you might have test failures that only happen with webkit on _windows_ or _chromium_ on linux
- you can these tests locally via yarn `test-browser --browser chromium --browser webkit`
- to debug, open  `<vscode>/test/unit/browser/renderer.html` inside a browser and use the `?m=<amd_module>`-query to specify what AMD module to load, e.g `file:///Users/jrieken/Code/vscode/test/unit/browser/renderer.html?m=vs/base/test/common/strings.test` runs all tests from `strings.test.ts`
- to run only a subset of tests use the `--run` or `--glob` options
